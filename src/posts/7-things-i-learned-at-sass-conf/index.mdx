This fall I attended [SassConf](http://sassconf.com/) in Austin, Texas. It was a 3-day event filled with attendees with all kinds of backgrounds: front-end, back-end, and designers. I've been writing Sass for over 2 years now, and felt as though this would be an awesome way for me to meet other Sass developers and level-up my Sass skills.

Here are some quick takeaways from my time in Austin:

## 1. Sass Maps (@get-maps)

Before attending Sass Conf, I thought Sass maps and sourcemaps where the same thing.

Basically, Sass maps are a data-type that give developers a way to structure data, similar to JSON with key/value pairings. Una Kravets has a [excellent article](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) what Sass maps are and some use cases for them.

Slide decks for both talks on Sass maps:

1. [Chris Suave's deck](http://www.slideshare.net/chrismsauve/sassconf-slides-chris-sauve 'Slide Deck')
2. [Lourdes Montano's deck](http://www.slideshare.net/loumontano/sassconf-maps 'Slide Deck')

## 2. For Loops (@for)

As a WordPress developer, I'm super familiar with how loops work, so getting exposed to them in a Sass perspective was't too difficult for me. In fact,
having programmatic concepts like loops on the CSS side of things blew me away.

I attended [Eva Ferreira's](https://github.com/evaferreira "Eva's GitHub Profile") _Looping For Animation_ workshop. We did all kinds of neat things with animations, SVGs and loops. Turns out, animation is an awesome use-case for loops.

Check out the CodePen demo on a simple animation loop she had us do. Super cool.

## 3. SCSS Linting

Scss linting allows developers to create style rules for Sass. A style rule can be something like "Don't indent more than 3 levels deep" or "No IDs". This can be
really cool for teams or open-source projects. [Check out the project files](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint 'Sass Lint GitHub Page') for
more info.

## 4. Using VIM

Even though VIM isn't directly associated with Sass, as developers it's a tool we can use in our day-to-day. During the unconf portion of the conference (which
is pretty much a day where everyone meets at a place to discuss their projects
and share knowledge), one of the attendees decided to show us VIM and how he
uses it.

It's super rad and a major time saver. I'm using the Atom VIM wrapper for my
projects, and so far it's helping.

## 5. How to contribute to open source projects

During unconf, I joined Una who shared her [CSSgram](https://github.com/una/CSSgram 'CSSgram') open-source project. The
biggest takeaway was how easy it is to contribute to a project. Given that a
project has some clear instructions on how to contribute, Una made contributing
seem very approachable and welcomed by open-source contributors.

Throughout the conference, there were other workshops and talks on open-source
and contributing, so there was definitely a good vibe of contributing during the
conference.

## 6. Contributing to the Sass project isn't that difficult to do

I initially felt that there wasn't anything I could do to contribute to the community since I'm not a Ruby or C developer. However, I met Jina, who maintains the Sass website, and I realized that I could contribute in other ways that match my skill set such as documentation, design and front-end work.

## 7. Take advantage of the Sass functions out there

Roy Tomeij gave a super-informative [talk on built-in Sass functions](http://sassconf.com/speakers/roy-tomeij.html 'Roy Tomeij SassConf Page'). In fact, he went of all 80 functions in his talk - a super lighting talk
indeed. All kidding aside, Sass comes with a lot of functions that make our lives
as developers much easier. Check out the docs and get going!
