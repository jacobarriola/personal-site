excerpt: How to extend the WooCommerce GraphQL API to include the Product Bundles add-on via WPGraphQL WPGraphQL WooCommerce (WooGraphQL)
---

## Introduction

This tutorial is to show you how to add the [WooCommerce Product Bundle](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/ 'WooCommerce Product Bundle add on documentation') product type to your WooCommerce GraphQL API. This is definitely a work-in-progress that I'll try and keep updated.

The two plugins in use here are:

1. [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql 'WPGraphQL Github repository'): 0.10.2
2. [WPGraphQL WooCommerce (WooGraphQL)](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce 'WPGraphQL WooCommerce Github repository'): 0.5.1

### Begin with the end in mind

Ideally, this is the shape of the GraphQL query that we're shooting for:

```graphql
query {
  products {
    name
    shortDescription
    ... on BundleProduct {
      price
      bundledItems {
        node {
          name
          shortDescription
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TLDR - the final code

Check out the gist for the full implementation: https://gist.github.com/jacobarriola/5d055ba102c001f0c556427a1ae78cd2

### Here are the high level steps that I intend to take:

1. Register the `BundleProduct` ObjectType
2. Register a `RootQuery` field for the new ObjectType
3. Expose the new `BundleProduct` object type to WooCommerce GraphQL's list of product types
4. Expose the new `BundleProduct` to the product types enum values so that query input filters will work
5. Add fields to the `BundleProduct` ObjectType
6. Create a Connection to expose bundleItems to `BundleProduct`

## Product is a GraphQL Interface

An important WooCommerce GraphQL architectural concept to grasp is that a `Product` is an Interface type and all `product_types` (simple, variable, external, grouped) are _implementations_ of the `Product` Interface.

> 📕 Say what?! Check out the GraphQL docs on what an Interface is: https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces

In normal WooCommerce-land, `product_types` (simple, variable, external, grouped) are simply terms for the `product_type` custom taxonomy. The Product Bundle add-on extends this same pattern by creating a term `bundle` for the `product_type` taxonomy.

Therefore, in order to add product bundles to our GraphQL API, we're going to follow the same implementation pattern that the core product types already follow in WooGraphQL and implement and `Product` interface.

## Step one: add the bundle product type to GraphQL product types

This filter allows us to safely add our `bundle` product type. The underlying method uses this list to expose the WooCommerce product types (simple, variable, external, grouped) to the GraphQL schema.

```php
add_filter( 'graphql_woocommerce_product_types', function ( $product_types ) {
	$product_types['bundle'] = 'BundleProduct';

	return $product_types;
} );
```

## Step two: add the `BundleProduct` ObjectType to the GraphQL TypeRegistry

This is the meat of our customization. We're bascially declaring our new Type along with all of the fields.

```php{numberLines: true}

add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function () {

	/**
   * Register BundleProduct ObjectType
   */
	register_graphql_object_type( 'BundleProduct', [
			'description' => 'A product bundle object',
			'interfaces'  => [ 'Node', 'Product' ], // Following same pattern that other product types declare
			'fields'      =>
				[
					'bundlePriceMin' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_bundle_price('min');
						}
					],
					'bundlePriceMax' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_bundle_price('max');
						}
					],
					'groupMode'=> [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_group_mode();
						}
					],
					'price' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_price();
						},
					],
					'salePrice' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_sale_price();
						},
					],
					'regularPrice' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return $source->get_regular_price();
						},
					],
					'bundledItems' => [
						'type'    => 'String',
						'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
							return 'this is still a work-in-progress';
						},
					],
				],
		]
	);
} );
```

### Why are product bundle methods available?

By default, the first parameter in a field resolver is always the latest thing that was queried. In our case, we are querying `Product` types because of the `Product` interface; therefore, the `$source` parameter is an instance of the `WPGraphQL\WooCommerce\Model\Product` class.

But if you explore the class, you won't find any of the Product Bundle methods I'm using (ie `get_bundle_price()`). But why isn't PHP throwing any fatal `cannot find get_bundle_price() method in ...` errors? This is because the presence of a `__call()` [magic PHP method](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php 'Documentation on magic methods') in the _parent_ class (`WPGraphQL\WooCommerce\Model\Crud_CPT`), which allows us to call dynamic or inaccessible methods that are not definded in the class.

## Step three: register a GraphQL field with our new Type

The Type will not appear on our GraphQL API until we register at least one field. For now, I'm registering a `RootQuery` so that consumer can query `bundleProduct` directly like the other product types.

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function () {

  register_graphql_field(
      'RootQuery',
      'bundleProduct',
      [
        'type' => TYPE_BUNDLE_PRODUCT,
      ]
  );
});

```

## Step four: add bundle to the product types enum

Doing so will include our new `BundleProduct` to be included in the `where` argument when querying products.

```php

add_filter( 'graphql_product_types_enum_values', function ( $values ) {
	$values['BUNDLE'] = [
		'value'       => 'bundle',
		'description' => 'A bundle product',
	];

	return $values;
} );

```

## Step five: create a new Connection in order to return bundle items

This step was long enough to [deserve its own post](/post/graphql-woocommerce-connection-product-bundles).

## Conclusion

Still more work here, but hopefully this will get you started. There's still plenty to be done, such as:

1. add bundle to the cart
2. more that I haven't thought of 🤷🏽‍♂️
