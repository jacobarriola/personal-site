excerpt: Learn how to create a custom GraphQL Connection Type between product bundles and their bundle items in WPGraphQL and WooGraphQL.
---

## Introduction

This post is to demonstrate how to create a GraphQL Connection Type between Product Bundles and Bundle Items in [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql 'WPGraphQL GitHub repository') within the context of the [WooGraphQL extension](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce 'WooGraphQL Github repository').

It's also a continuation of a previous post where I discussed [how to add product bundles to your GraphQL schema](/post/woocommerce-graphql-product-bundles).

### tldr

The final implementation is on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/jacobarriola/76ba565039c0e32f484be385969d4aca)

## Connections in GraphQL

In GraphQL - because we think about our data in a graph - a Connection is a joining of two nodes within our graph.

Caleb Meredith has an awesome [post that explains GraphQL Connections](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/explaining-graphql-connections-c48b7c3d6976/).

In my case, I'm building an extension for [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/bundles/) for the WooGraphQL extension, so I needed a way to connect a product bundle to its children (also known as bundle items).

> Really quick, if you're not familiar with Product Bundles, it's basically a parent-child relationship between `product` post types. It gives ecommerce owners the ability to group multiple products together. The parent is the bundle, and the underlying children are their bundle items.

## Shape of our query

Cool, now that we have a sense of the architecture, let's get down to solving our problem.

Ideally, here's the shape of the query that we'll be shooting for (the `bundleItems` field is where we'll be living):

```graphql
{
  products {
    nodes {
      name
      price
      productId
      ...on BundleProduct {
        bundleItems {
          edges {
            quantityMin
            quantityMax
            node {
              name
              productId
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}

```

Basically, what we're querying is: "go get me the first n products, if a product is a product bundle, go get me its children, along with some data that's relevent to their relationship".

> Keep an eye on those two `quantityMin` and `quantityMax` edge fields. We'll touch upon those later.

## Steps to create the connection

There will be two steps we'll be taking to create our connection: registering and resolving.

### Step one: register the connection

WPGraphQL has a function called `register_graphql_connection()` that we'll use to create the connection. We can safely call this function as part of a callback during the `graphql_register_types` action.

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function () {
	register_graphql_connection( [
		'fromType'      => 'BundleProduct',
		'toType'        => 'Product',
		'fromFieldName' => 'bundleItems',
		'resolve'       => function ( $source, $args, $context, $info ) {
			return 'GraphQL is lit!';
		},
	] );
} );
```

The [WPGraphQL docs](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extending/connections/#config) does a good job of defining the parameters of the the function, so read up on the definitions. But basically, we're defining where the connection is coming from and where it's going to.

### Step two: configure the resolver

The `resolve` function feels like [WordPress pre_get_posts-land](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/pre_get_posts/ 'WordPress pre_get_posts documentation'). In other words, this is an opportunity for us to short-circuit the query before it's run.

In our case, we want to adjust the query variables to only include certain posts (our bundle items).

The resolver essentially needs two things: instantiate a new connection resovler class (either your own or one that's pre-built) and return the `get_connection()` method for that class. The connection resolver class is responsible for setting up the query and connecting to a data loader.

For our case, I ended up using the existing [WooGraphQL Product Connection Resolver Class](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce/blob/develop/includes/data/connection/class-product-connection-resolver.php#L25), since my `$source` is a `product` post type and all I simply need to do is adjust one query parameter (I tried to mess around with creating my own resolver class, but quickly got lost in underlying assumptions that I didn't know about. It works for now, but I'll revisit later).

Here's what the resolver configuration looks like after our update:

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function () {
	register_graphql_connection( [
		'fromType'      => 'BundleProduct',
		'toType'        => 'Product',
		'fromFieldName' => 'bundleItems',
		'resolve'       => function ( $source, $args, $context, $info ) {
			$resolver = new Product_Connection_Resolver( $source, $args, $context, $info );

			return $resolver->get_connection();
		},
	] );
} );
```

Once we update our resolver, the query will now get the first 10 (or whatever your global `per_page` settings is set to) products. This is good, but we still need adjust the query to only retrieve the products that belong/relate to this bundle (ie the bundle items).

#### Figure out how to get the bundle items that belong to the current product bundle

Ok, so in this `resolve` callback, we know that the current `$source` value is a `BundleProduct` Type, which is a `product` post. In the database, the realtionships are stored in a custom table called `woocommcere_bundle_items`. Therefore, we'll need to write a query to get all of the bundle items that belong to our current bundle in the `resolve` callback.

Our query can look something like this:

```php
$wpdb->get_results( $wpdb->prepare( "
		SELECT
			product_id
		FROM
			{$wpdb->prefix}woocommerce_bundled_items
		WHERE
			bundle_id = 123456
		LIMIT 10
		"
) );
```

Nothing too crazy here. All we're looking to get back is an array of product IDs that are associated with our Product Bundle.

#### Update the resolver with our bundle item IDs

Now that we have an array of IDs, we can update our resolver (throwing in sample IDs for demo purposes):

```php
add_action( 'graphql_register_types', function () {
	register_graphql_connection( [
		'fromType'      => 'BundleProduct',
		'toType'        => 'Product',
		'fromFieldName' => 'bundleItems',
		'resolve'       => function ( $source, $args, $context, $info ) {
			$resolver = new Product_Connection_Resolver( $source, $args, $context, $info );

			$resolver->set_query_arg( 'post__in', [ 123, 456 ] );

			return $resolver->get_connection();
		},
	] );
} );
```

The `set_query_arg()` method is the mechanism that allows us to safely set the query arguments before it's run. You can use [any WP_Query parameter](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#parameters) here. Why? If you explore the `Product_Connection_Resolver` and [look at the get_query() method](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce/blob/develop/includes/data/connection/class-product-connection-resolver.php#L319), you'll see that it eventually runs `WP_Query`.

#### `set_query_arg` does not work here

In a perfect world, this would be all we need; however, despite setting the `post__in` query argument, my query was still returning back the first 10 product posts. I have an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce/issues/321) that documents this.

##### **Workaround**

Luckily, we can hook into a query args filter that runs really late to safely add our `post__in` argument.

```php
add_filter( 'graphql_product_connection_query_args', function ( $query_args, $source, $args, $context, $info ) {

	// Bail if this isn't a bundle. This filter runs on all product types
	if ( 'bundle' !== $source->type ) {
		return $query_args;
	}

	$query_args['post__in'] = [ 123, 456 ];

	return $query_args;
}, 10, 5 );
```

## Edge fields

Remember our two `productMin` and `productMax` edge fields? I struggled a lot with this concept and how it relates to the problem we're trying to solve.

Edge fields represent **data in the context of the relationship between nodes**. The line between two nodes are called edges; any data that lives on that virutal line is called an edge field.

> ðŸ“º Jason Bahl has a good [explanation of this concepet on YouTube](https://youtu.be/2qYn3VPcTpE?t=826) within the scope of WordPress

Say you have a property rental application where a node could be a `User` Type and a `Property` Type. A `Property` will have a relationship with a `User` because a user will rent a property. While each of the Types will contain data about itself (`User`: name, DOB, ID, etc; `Property`: address, beds, baths, etc), there is data that is based on _context of the relationship_: rental start date, rental end date, rental ID, etc. This data doesn't really belong to the `User` or the `Property`; it belongs to their relationship. That's edge data!

Back to our case. The `BundleProduct` and `Product` connection have properties of their context. This includes things such as `quantityMin`, `quantityMax`, amongst others. Because it's a property of the relationship, we're delibertaly exposing the data on the edge.

#### How to add edge fields to the bundle items

There's an `edgeFields` property in the `register_graphql_connection` method configuration where we pass in an array a fields we want to expose to the edge schema.

Inside each field we declare, there's a friendly `resolve` property, which we'll use to write our logic for the given field.

```php
register_graphql_connection( [
	'fromType'      => 'BundleProduct',
	'toType'        => 'Product',
	'fromFieldName' => 'bundleItems',
	'resolve'       => function ( $source, $args, $context, $info ) {
		$resolver = new Product_Connection_Resolver( $source, $args, $context, $info );

		return $resolver->get_connection();
	},
	'edgeFields'    => [
		'quantityMin' => [
			'type'    => 'Int',
			'resolve' => function () {
				return 'GraphQL is LIT';
			},
		],
	],
] );
```

The `$source` parameter returns an array with four items:

- cursor - a hash used for pagination
- node - the product itself, an instance `WPGraphQL\WooCommerce\Model\Product`
- source - the product bundle, an instance `WPGraphQL\WooCommerce\Model\Product`
- connection = our connection resolver `Product_Connection_Resolver`

Unfortunately, the data for bundle items isn't stored in `postmeta`, so we can't fire off a quick `get_post_meta( $source['node']->ID, 'quantity_min', true )` and call it a day. Instead, data is stored in a custom meta table, so we need to figure out a way to efficiently get that data.

We don't want to write custom SQL or instantiate classes at each field; rather, we need a way to expose all the data to this resolver beforehand, so that fields can simply pluck the data they need and return it. Filters to the rescue!

The filter we'll be using is `graphql_connection_edges`, which is run at the `Product_Connection_Resolver` level as it's setting all of the data for the edges. What we want to do is instantiate a pre-built `WC_Bundled_Item_Data` class on our given node and expose it to the resolver's `$source` attribute.

This filter runs on all connections, so we need to run some checks to ensure our logic on runs on bundle items.

```php
/**
 * Inject the WC_Bundled_Item_Data Class into the resolver so that fields can access
 * edge data
 */
add_filter( 'graphql_connection_edges', function ( $edges, $resolver ) {
	$source = $resolver->getSource();

	// Bail if our $source isn't a bundle
	if ( 'bundle' !== $source->type ) {
		return $edges;
	}

	// Get some info about the $resolver
	$resolverInfo = $resolver->getInfo();

	// Get the name of the field we are resolving
	$fieldName = $resolverInfo->fieldName;

	// Bail if our field isn't bundleItems
	if ( 'bundleItems' !== $fieldName ) {
		return $edges;
	}

  // Go get all of the bundle items for this product bundle
	$bundled_data_items = $resolver->getSource()->get_bundled_data_items();

	// Go through each edge, find the bundle item id, and set the bundleItem
	foreach ( $edges as $key => $edge ) {

		$raw_bundled_data_item = array_filter( $bundled_data_items, function ( WC_Bundled_Item_Data $item ) use ( $edge ) {
			return $item->get_product_id() === $edge['node']->ID;
		} );

		if ( empty( $raw_bundled_data_item ) ) {
			$edges[ $key ]['bundledItem'] = [];
			continue;
		}

		$bundled_data_item = array_values( $raw_bundled_data_item );

		// Expose the bundleItem so that the resolver can get edge data
		$edges[ $key ]['bundledItem'] = WC_PB_DB::get_bundled_item( $bundled_data_item[0]->get_bundled_item_id() );
	}

	return $edges;
}, 10, 2 );
```

Lots happening here, but the meat of our logic is happening on the `foreach`, where we find the bundled item, get its id and set the bundle item data so that it's available on the resolver.

Now, our each resolver function has access to the `WC_Bundle_Item_Data` instance for its bundle item, and can properly resolve data. Great success!

```php
'quantityMin' => [
  'type'    => 'Int',
  'resolve' => function ( $source ) {
    /* @var $bundledItem WC_Bundled_Item_Data */
    $bundledItem = $source['bundledItem'];

    return $bundledItem->get_meta( 'quantity_min' );
  },
],
```

## Conclusion

Before I started, I knew nothing about connections, loaders and edges. But with some help with XDEBUG, I was able to open up the source code and get a sense of what was happening behind the scenes.

As always, there's room for improvement. Ideally I'd like to make my own connection resolver (and subsequent data loader) class because running all my logic via filters feels a bit hacky, especially with all of the checks that I have to do. Both WPGraphQL and WooGraphQL write their own classes, so I'll follow their pattern.

Next steps are to see how cart, checkout and orders need to be altered to accomodate product bundles.
