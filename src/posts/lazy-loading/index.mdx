excerpt: There are a lot of opinions on lazy loading images. Here's a use-case for one scenario that worked out nicely for me.
---

The other day I was handed a design for a large navigation menu with images. An image would show when a user hovered over the individual menu item - a pretty common navigation UI.

My biggest concern was how to load these images only when the
visitor required them, especially because they are not visible to the user
unless she engages with the navigation, which may not happen all the time.

## The plan

**The problem** - the navigation contains a large amount of images, which may impact site load time.

**The solution** - only load a navigation image when user hovers over the associated menu item.

**The technique** - on hover, replace a `span` tag with an `img` tag and copy the attributes over.

## The markup

I've created a `span` element with a custom attribute named `data-original`, which contains the path to my image.

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="trigger">Hover over me to fetch an image</h1>
  <span data-original="http://www.fillmurray.com/200/200">
</div>
```

## The JavaScript

I have an event listener for the `.trigger` class that will do a quick search and replace, copying what I have in the `data-original` to the `src`.

## CodePen demo

I have a red box that is the `span` tag. Once you hover over the box, the JS fires and loads the image.

<p
  data-height="268"
  data-theme-id="21239"
  data-slug-hash="dGGzxK"
  data-default-tab="result"
  data-user="jacobarriola"
  class="codepen"

## Progressive Enhancement

Well, the image contains other meta data that I didn't include here such as
the post title and excerpt. Therefore, in the event that JavaScript is not
available, the user will still be able to tell what she is looking at and can still click through - yay!

## What About SEO?

From what I understand, we shouldn't get penalized since the DOM intially reads as a `span` tag. I was orginally going to use an `img` tag and just swap out attributes, but was concerned about search engines penalizing me for having an `img` tag without a `src` attribute.
