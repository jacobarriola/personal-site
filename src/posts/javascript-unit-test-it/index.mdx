## Introduction

If you're going to build a headless WooCommerce application, you generally have two options when it comes to checkout:

A) Build it yourself

--OR--

B) Offload to WordPress

> ‚úãüèº Yep, I know there are some hosted checkout plugins for WordPress, but for the sake of simplicity, this post isn't about reviewing those plugins.

## Option A: build the checkout yourself

This is a totally feasabile solution. The WooGraphQL has a `checkout` mutation that will create the order and handle the payment gateway for you.

üí° Example: See my post about a detailed implementation: <Link to="/post/headless-woocommerce-stripe-checkout-graphql">build a checkout page for your headless WooCommerce app with React</Link>.

### The pros of building your own checkout:

1. You have complete control of the UI (üëàüèΩ this may be the deal breaker)
2. It's fast
3. It's a seemless experience

### The cons of building your own checkout:

1. You have to build the entire UI - yes, you get the blank canvas, but that means you need to build it
2. You have to deal with form validation
3. You have to handle errors - checkout errors, gateway errors
4. You have to build another route for the confirmation page
5. You have to learn about the payment gateway SDKs (Stripe, PayPal, etc)
6. There may be existing functionality that you have to integrate such as adding users to a newsletter upon checkout
7. WTF is PCI compliance and do you need to support it? I don't know it, and would rather spend time on solving business problems than dealing with learning and supporting this
8. What if you want to start supporting Google and Apple Pay?
9. Has your implementation gone through the wringer? Is there something in production that you can trust or is this the first implementation? If so, checkout is a critical piece of the business, and you probably don't want to mess it up üòÄ
10. Authentication - how can you ensure that authenticated users' orders get associated with their account?

Based on this list, it _seems_ that the cons far outweigh the pros; however, if a very specific UI is required and cannot be built in WordPress, building your own may be an optimal option.

## Option B: offload to WordPress

The idea behind this is to send your users from the cart page to the WordPress checkout page, which lives in a different domain.

üí° Read my detailed implementation about <Link to="/post/hosted-woocommerce-checkout-headless-application">offloading checkout to WordPress</Link>.

### The pros of offloading checkout to WordPress:

1. It already works - form validation, error handling and payment gateways are already in place
2. No need to deal with custom payment gateway integration
3. 3rd party plugins that hook into checkout will continue to work
4. The confirmation page is already built
5. Authentication will work (kind of - see below)

### The cons of offloading checkout to WordPress:

1. You have to properly handoff the cart session from your decoupled app to WordPress, otherwise the cart will be empty when the checkout page loads
2. Unless you're using cookie authentication, your users will have to log in again
3. The page may be slow to load, especially on mobile, since it's WordPress
4. You need to ensure that branding properly matches the headless app so that users aren't confused

## Conclusion

These days, I lean more towards offloading the checkout to WordPress. That way I can stay focused on solving unique business challenges.
