excerpt: How to load WPGraphQL via mu-plugins wih composer.

While the docs say to [add WPGraphQL to your WordPress plugin directory](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/getting-started/install-and-activate/#github---download--clone-plugin 'WPGraphQL documentation page') (`wp-content/plugins`), here's a quick config if you want to add it to your mu-plugins instead.

This configuration assumes your composer file sits in `wp-content`.

## Why mu-plugins (must-use)?

I like to add core logic in mu-plugins because:

- no one can ever accidentally disable your logic, thereby causing unexpected errors
- all custom app logic is neatly organized in a central place as opposed to mixed in with 3rd party libraries or within a theme
- the code always loads; no need to activate anything

## tldr - the final composer json config

Here's the final `composer.json` file that you'll want to use.

```json
{
  "name": "wpgrapql",
  "type": "project",
  "license": "proprietary",
  "config": {
    "preferred-install": "dist",
    "vendor-dir": "mu-plugins/app/vendor"
  },
  "extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
      "mu-plugins/{$name}/": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin",
        "wp-graphql/wp-graphql",
        "wp-graphql/wp-graphiql"
      ]
    }
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql"
    },
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "php": ">=7.4",
    "composer/installers": "^1.5",
    "wp-graphql/wp-graphql": "^0.8.0",
    "wp-graphql/wp-graphiql": "^1.0"
  }
}
```

## Let's break down this composer file step-by-step.

### Add the Github repositories in the repositories array

In your `composer.json` file, add the WPGraphQL GitHub repos to the `repositories` array. This tells composer to pull its data from GitHub, as opposed to packagist. Sometimes there's a slight delay on when a version is available in packagist.

```json
 "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql"
    },
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql"
    }
  ]

```

### Provide the install path

This tells composer _where_ to install the packages.

```json
"extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
      "mu-plugins/{$name}/": [
        "type:wordpress-muplugin",
        "wp-graphql/wp-graphql",
        "wp-graphql/wp-graphiql"
      ]
    }
  },
```

### Install via composer

Now that all of the settings are in place, you can go ahead an run the composer install commands.

```shell
composer require wp-graphql/wp-graphql
composer require wp-graphql/wp-graphiql
```

### Load the files

I usually have a `mu-plugins/load.php` file that simply fires off some requires.

```php
// wp-content/mu-plugins/load.php

require_once __DIR__ . '/wp-graphql/wp-graphql.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/wp-graphiql/wp-graphiql.php';
```

WPGraphQL should now load on your site as expected!
